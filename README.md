# Welcoe

This package is a small wrapper for some of the APIs provided by AbuseIPDB API (https://www.abuseipdb.com)
It can be used for checking bad actors / bad IPs

## Running tests

The tests depend on an API key.  You have to set this as an environment variable before running the tests:

```bash
export ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
go test -v
```

## TODO:

Create basic go docs - see https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/blob/master/datastore/doc.go
